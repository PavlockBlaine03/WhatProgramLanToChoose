            <h2 class="title">Python</h2>
            <p>Python is a high-level, versatile, and interpreted programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.<br> 
                Python emphasizes readability, simplicity, and ease of use, making it an excellent choice for beginners as well as experienced developers.<br>
                Some key features and characteristics of Python include:</p>
            <ul id="list">
                <li>Easy to learn and use</li>
                <li>Open-source</li>
                <li>High-level language</li>
                <li>Portable</li>
                <li>Object-oriented</li>
                <li>Extensible</li>
                <li>Interpreted</li>
                <li>Large standard library</li>
                <li>Dynamic typing</li>
                <li>Integrated</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="note">Side note:</p>
            <aside id="sidenote">Python follows a set of guiding principles known as the "Zen of Python," 
                which captures the philosophy and design principles that shape the language. Conceived by Tim Peters, these aphorisms<br>
                provide insights into the mindset of Python developers and include ideas such as readability counts, explicit is better than implicit, <br>
                and there should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. The Zen of Python serves as a guiding light for Python developers,<br>
                encouraging code clarity and simplicity. You can view the Zen of Python by typing import this in a Python interpreter. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4" target="_blank">HERE</a>

            <h2 class="title">Java</h2>
            <p>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that was designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
                It was first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. Java is known for its "write once, run anywhere" 
                capability, which means that Java code can run on any device that supports Java without the need for recompilation. Some key features and characteristics of Java include:</p>
            <ul id="list">
                <li>Platform independence</li>
                <li>Object-oriented</li>
                <li>Robust</li>
                <li>Secure</li>
                <li>Multi-threaded</li>
                <li>Architecture-neutral</li>
                <li>Interpreted</li>
